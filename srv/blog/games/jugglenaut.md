This is my first game-a-week game. It is best played with a gamepad controller. I've tested on linux with a wired XBOX controller and PS3 controller but theoretically most gamepads that work with your computer should work.


In juggling a ["flash"][flash] is throwing and catching each ball once and a "qualify" is to throw and catch each ball twice. Qualifying 3 balls in this game is quite a challenge!
