This is my second game a week game.

# Background
In this game you play an alien out in space. A human astronaut in distress floats your way. You can attempt to help them by logging into their ship and opening the airlock.

# Hints & FAQ (minor spoilers)
- Problems related to user names: the console that asks for a username is the from the astronaut's spaceship. You don't have a username for it because you aren't a NASA employee. Perhaps you can impersonate a nearby employee?
- Problems with dates: there are a few security questions that ask for dates. These are easily answerable if you have found the right pieces of information. You should be able to do any of the math on your fingers. It might seem harder than that if you don't have all the relevant clues.
- Problems with missing information: all the information needed to answer the questions is available by clicking the astronaut. If you aren't able to answer a question you probably A) missed a piece of information or B) the informationd you have doesn't exactly say the answer and you need to make a resonable guess (or multiple) based on the information you do know. All the items that give information pulse green when you hover over them. Unfortunately this is a little hard to see on some layers or on small items, or if you have visual impairments, sorry! There are also items on every layer!
